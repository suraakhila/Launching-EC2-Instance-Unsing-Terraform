# 🚀 **Terraform Quick Guide**

- **Terraform** is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool for managing cloud resources.
- Use **`terraform init`** to initialize your project and **`terraform apply`** to deploy infrastructure. 🚀
- Install Terraform by downloading it from [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html). 📥
- Verify installation with **`terraform --version`**. ✅
- Write configurations in `.tf` files, like creating an EC2 instance in AWS. 🖥️
- Always use **state files** securely to track resources. 🔒
- Use **modules** to reuse code across projects. 📂
- Common commands include **`terraform plan`**, **`terraform apply`**, and **`terraform destroy`**. 🔄
- Store **state files** remotely for collaboration (e.g., AWS S3). ☁️
